# VIGENERE CIPHER ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION

### Project Description

This project revolves around Vigenere cipher which is a method of encrypting/decrypting text  
Using a unique text and key given by the user, Vigenere cipher will output an encrypted/decrypted text through an algorithm by aligning each character of the text to each character of the key.

#### Programming Approach

* This program is entirely C++  

* This program allows the user to encrypt and decrypt by using the Vigenere cipher algorithms...  

  **Encryption: E = (P[i] + K[i]) mod 26 + 65**  
  
  **Decryption: D = (C[i] - K[i] mod 26 + 65**  

### Instructions
When launching the program...  
1. Choose either to encrypt a text, decrypt a text, or end the program  
2. If choosing to either encrypt or decrypt a text then input your unique text  
3. After entering your text, enter your unique key when it asks  
4. Done, the Vigenere cipher is complete
