# VIGENERE CIPHER ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION

### Project Description

This project revolves around Vigenere cipher which is a method of encrypting/decrypting text  
Using a unique text and key given by the user, Vigenere cipher will output an encrypted/decrypted text by aligning where the text and key intersects on the Vigenere table.  

##### Programming Approach

This program is entirely C++  
The Vigenere cipher algorithm used in this program is...  

  Encryption: E = (P[i] + K[i]) mod 26 + 65  
  
  Decryption: D = (C[i] - K[i] mod 26 + 65
